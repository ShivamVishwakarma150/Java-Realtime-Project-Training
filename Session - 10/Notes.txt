Git Branches
+++++++++++

-> Git Branches are used to maintain separate code bases for our project

-> Multiple teams can work Parallely using Git Branches Concept

-> In GiT repository we can create multiple branches

master / main
develop
qa
release
research

-> development team will integrate the code in 'develop' branch

-> bug-fixing team will integrate the code in 'qa' branch

-> R & D team will integrate the code in 'research' branch


-> In github we can create branches

-> To clone particular branch in git repo we will use below command

		$ git clone -b <branch-name> <repo-url>


Note: We can create any no of branches in one repository

-> If you are working on any R&D task then it is better to use new branch for your r&d so that existing functionality will not break.


Steps to do branch merging
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) Create feature branch from main branch

2) clone feature branch 

3) create new file in feature branch then commit and push to central repo

4) Go to central repository then create pull request to merge feature branch changes to main branch

Note: Once feature branch changes are merged to main branch then we can delete feature branch (if required)

################################
How to clone particular Branch 
################################

# To clone default branch (main or master)
$ git clone <repo-url>

# To clone specific branch 
$ git clone  -b <branch-name> <repo-url>

-> We can merge changes from one branch to another branch using 'pull request'.


+++++++++++++++++
Branch Switching 
+++++++++++++++++

-> Using git bash we can switch from one branch to another branch using 'checkout' command 


$ git checkout main // if you all ready in develop branch

What is .gitignore ?
+++++++++++++++++++++

-> This .gitignore is used to configure the files or folders which we want to ignore from our commits

-> The files and folders which are not required to commit to central repository those things we can configure in .gitignore file

Ex: In maven project 'target' folder will be available which is not required to commit to central repository. This we can configure in .gitignore file.
