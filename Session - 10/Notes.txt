-> Git Branches are used to maintain separate code bases for our project

-> Multiple teams can work Parallely using Git Branches Concept

-> In GiT repository we can create multiple branches

master / main
develop
qa
release
research

-> development team will integrate the code in 'develop' branch

-> bug-fixing team will integrate the code in 'qa' branch

-> R & D team will integrate the code in 'research' branch


-> In github we can create branches

-> To clone particular branch in git repo we will use below command

		$ git clone -b <branch-name> <repo-url>


Note: We can create any no of branches in one repository

-> If you are working on any R&D task then it is better to use new branch for your r&d so that existing functionality will not break.
