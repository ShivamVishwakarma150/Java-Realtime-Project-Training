The provided code appears to be a Spring Boot application for managing plans and plan categories. It includes several components such as entities, repositories, services, and REST controllers. Here's a breakdown of the code structure and functionality:

1. Entity Classes:
   - `Plan`: Represents a plan with attributes such as planId, planName, planStartDate, planEndDate, activeSw, planCategoryId, createdBy, updatedBy, createDate, and updateDate.
   - `PlanCategory`: Represents a plan category with attributes such as categoryId, categoryName, activeSw, createdBy, updatedBy, createDate, and updateDate.

2. Repository Classes:
   - `PlanRepo`: Handles the persistence and retrieval of `Plan` entities.
   - `PlanCategoryRepo`: Handles the persistence and retrieval of `PlanCategory` entities.

3. Service Interface:
   - `PlanService`: Defines the contract for managing plans and provides methods such as getPlanCategories, savePlan, getAllPlans, getPlanById, updatePlan, deletePlanById, and planStatusChange.

4. Service Implementation:
   - `PlanServiceImpl`: Implements the `PlanService` interface and provides the actual implementation for managing plans. It interacts with the `PlanRepo` and `PlanCategoryRepo` for data operations.

5. REST Controller:
   - `PlanRestController`: Exposes REST endpoints for managing plans. It handles requests such as retrieving plan categories, saving a new plan, retrieving all plans, editing a plan, deleting a plan, updating a plan, and changing the status of a plan.

6. Configuration Classes:
   - `CorsConfig`: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from a specific origin (http://localhost:3000 in this case).
   - `SwaggerConfig`: Enables Swagger API documentation and configures the base package for scanning REST controllers.

7. Properties Class:
   - `AppProperties`: Holds application properties defined in the `plan-api` section of the application configuration file.

Note: Please make sure to import the required dependencies and configure the database connection properly for the code to work correctly.

Overall, this code provides a basic structure for managing plans and plan categories using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and RESTful APIs.

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided code:

1. **Application.java**:
   - This is the main class of the Spring Boot application.
   - It uses the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which is a convenience annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the application, which starts the Spring Boot application using `SpringApplication.run()`.

2. **CorsConfig.java**:
   - This class is a configuration class that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the application.
   - It implements the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface, which provides callback methods to customize the configuration of the Spring MVC framework.
   - The `addCorsMappings` method is overridden to configure CORS mappings.
   - In this case, all origins (`"http://localhost:3000"`) are allowed, and the HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and headers are specified as well. Additionally, it allows credentials.

3. **SwaggerConfig.java**:
   - This class is a configuration class that enables Swagger for API documentation.
   - It uses the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation to enable Swagger support.
   - The `apiDoc` method creates a `Docket` bean, which is the primary interface to configure Swagger.
   - The `select()` method configures the API selection for Swagger. In this case, it selects all APIs in the package `"com.shivam.rest"`.
   - The `paths(PathSelectors.any())` method allows Swagger to generate documentation for all paths.
   - Finally, the `build()` method builds the `Docket` instance.

4. **AppConstants.java**:
   - This class defines various constant strings used in the application.
   - These constants represent messages or status codes related to plan operations.

5. **Plan.java**:
   - This class represents the `Plan` entity, which is mapped to the `"PLAN_MASTER"` table in the database.
   - It uses the `@Entity` annotation to specify that this class is an entity.
   - The `@Data` annotation, provided by the Lombok library, generates boilerplate code for getters, setters, and other common methods.
   - The class includes attributes such as `planId`, `planName`, `planStartDate`, `planEndDate`, `activeSw`, and others.
   - The attributes are annotated with various JPA annotations such as `@Column`, `@CreationTimestamp`, and `@UpdateTimestamp` to specify their mapping to table columns and handle timestamp values.
   - The `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used to specify the automatic generation strategy for the `planId` attribute.

6. **PlanCategory.java**:
   - This class represents the `PlanCategory` entity, which is mapped to the `"PLAN_CATEGORY"` table in the database.
   - It is similar to the `Plan` class and includes attributes such as `categoryId` and `categoryName`.
   - The attributes are annotated with JPA annotations like `@Column`, `@CreationTimestamp`, and `@UpdateTimestamp` for mapping and timestamp handling.

7. **AppProperties.java**:
   - This class represents the application properties.
   - The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation is used to bind properties with the `plan-api` prefix to this class.
   - The `messages` field is a `Map<String, String>` that holds various messages used in the application.

8. **PlanRestController.java**:
   - This class is the REST controller that handles requests related to plans and plan categories.
   - It uses the `@RestController` annotation, which combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody

`.
   - The class includes various RESTful endpoints (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`) that map to specific URL paths and HTTP methods.
   - The endpoints delegate the request processing to the `PlanService` interface.

9. **PlanService.java**:
   - This interface defines methods for managing plans.
   - It includes methods for getting plan categories, saving a new plan, retrieving all plans, updating a plan, deleting a plan, and changing the status of a plan.

10. **PlanServiceImpl.java**:
   - This class implements the `PlanService` interface.
   - It uses the `@Service` annotation to indicate that this class provides a business service.
   - The class includes the implementation of the methods defined in the `PlanService` interface.
   - The implementation includes interactions with the `PlanRepo` and `PlanCategoryRepo` repositories to perform CRUD operations on plans and plan categories.

11. **PlanRepo.java**:
   - This interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
   - It specifies the operations that can be performed on the `Plan` entity.
   - Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation of these operations.

12. **PlanCategoryRepo.java**:
   - This interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface.
   - It specifies the operations that can be performed on the `PlanCategory` entity.

That covers the explanation of the provided code.
