The code you provided consists of several Java classes related to a Spring Boot application that deals with eligibility details and generates reports based on search criteria. Here's a detailed explanation of each class:

1. `EligibilityDetailsRepo` (Interface):
   - This interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `EligibilityDetails` entity.
   - It includes two custom query methods:
     - `findPlanNames()`: Returns a list of distinct plan names from the `EligibilityDetails` table.
     - `findPlanStatuses()`: Returns a list of distinct plan statuses from the `EligibilityDetails` table.

2. `EligibilityDetails` (Entity):
   - This class represents the eligibility details of a person.
   - It is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a persistent entity.
   - The `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the database table associated with this entity.
   - It contains various attributes such as `eligid`, `name`, `mobile`, `email`, `gender`, `ssn`, `planName`, `planStatus`, `planStartDate`, `planEndDate`, `createDate`, `updateDate`, `createdBy`, and `updatedBy`.
   - The `@Data` annotation is from the Lombok library and automatically generates getters, setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

3. `SearchRequest` (Request):
   - This class represents the search criteria for eligibility details.
   - It includes attributes such as `planName`, `planStatus`, `planStartDate`, and `planEndDate`.
   - The `@Data` annotation generates the standard methods.

4. `SearchResponse` (Response):
   - This class represents the response data for the search operation.
   - It includes attributes that correspond to the selected fields from the `EligibilityDetails` entity.
   - The `@Data` annotation generates the standard methods.

5. `ReportService` (Interface):
   - This interface defines the contract for generating reports and performing search operations on eligibility details.
   - It declares methods such as `getUniquePlanNames()`, `getUniquePlanStatuses()`, `search()`, `generateExcel()`, and `generatePdf()`.
   - The interface is implemented by the `ReportServiceImpl` class.

6. `ReportServiceImpl` (Service Implementation):
   - This class implements the `ReportService` interface and provides the actual implementation of its methods.
   - It uses the `EligibilityDetailsRepo` repository for accessing the database.
   - The `getUniquePlanNames()` and `getUniquePlanStatuses()` methods delegate the corresponding queries to the repository.
   - The `search()` method performs a search operation based on the provided `SearchRequest`.
     - It creates an `Example` object using the `queryBuilder` with the criteria from the request.
     - It retrieves matching entities from the repository and maps them to `SearchResponse` objects.
   - The `generateExcel()` method generates an Excel file using Apache POI.
     - It fetches all the eligibility details from the repository and populates them in an Excel workbook.
     - The workbook is then written to the response output stream.
   - The `generatePdf()` method generates a PDF file using iText library.
     - It fetches all the eligibility details from the repository and populates them in a PDF document.
     - The document is then written to the response output stream.

Overall, this code represents a Spring Boot application with a repository, entity, request/response objects, and service implementation for managing eligibility details and generating reports in Excel and PDF formats.
