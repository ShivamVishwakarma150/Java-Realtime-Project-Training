git merge vs git rebase
++++++++++++++++++++++

=> These commands are used to merge changes from one branch to another branch

-> git merge will maintain commit history

-> git rebase will not maintain that rebase history

-> When we are working on particular sprint and we want to merge changes from one branch to another branch then we will use 'git merge' command

-> Once sprint-1 is delivered then we want to take latest code of sprint-1 to start sprint-2 development. In this scenario we don't need commit history so we will use 'git rebase' command.

What is git pull command 
++++++++++++++++++++++

-> pull command is used to take latest changes from repository to local

-> When we want to make some changes to code, it is always recommended to take git pull


Note: When we execute 'git pull' there is a chance of getting conflicts. We need to resolve the conflict and we should push the code without conflicts.
