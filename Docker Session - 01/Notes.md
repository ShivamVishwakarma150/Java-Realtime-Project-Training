# Here's a brief overview of each topic:

1) Application Stack:
An application stack refers to the collection of software components and technologies that are used together to build and run an application. It typically includes the operating system, programming language, frameworks, libraries, databases, and other tools necessary for the application to function.

2) Life without Docker:
In a traditional development and deployment environment without Docker, applications are typically installed and run directly on the host operating system. This approach often leads to dependency conflicts, configuration issues, and difficulties in reproducing the exact environment across different machines.

3) Life with Docker:
With Docker, applications are packaged into containers that encapsulate all the dependencies, configurations, and code required to run the application. Docker provides a consistent and isolated runtime environment, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy applications more efficiently and reliably.

4) Docker Introduction:
Docker is an open-source platform that enables you to automate the deployment of applications within containers. It provides a standardized way to package and distribute applications and their dependencies, making them portable across different environments.

5) Docker Architecture:
Docker follows a client-server architecture. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which manages the building, running, and distribution of Docker containers. The Docker daemon interacts with the host operating system's kernel, which provides the containerization capabilities.

6) Docker Installation (Linux VM - AWS):
To install Docker on a Linux virtual machine (such as an AWS EC2 instance), you can follow the official Docker documentation specific to your Linux distribution. Typically, it involves adding the Docker repository, installing Docker Engine, and configuring Docker to start on boot.

7) Docker Commands:
Docker provides a command-line interface (CLI) with a set of commands to interact with Docker and manage containers. Some common Docker commands include `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker stop`, `docker start`, `docker pull`, `docker push`, `docker images`, and `docker ps`.

8) Dockerfile:
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, adds application code and dependencies, sets environment variables, and configures the container. The Docker CLI uses the Dockerfile to automatically build the image.

9) Docker Network:
Docker provides networking capabilities to allow containers to communicate with each other and the external world. Docker networks can be created to isolate containers or connect them to specific networks. Containers within the same network can communicate using their container names or IP addresses.

10) Docker Volumes:
Docker volumes provide a way to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container. Volumes can be mounted within containers to store and share data between containers or between containers and the host machine. Volumes are also used to manage data in databases and other stateful applications.

11) Docker Compose:
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to specify the services, networks, and volumes required by the application. Docker Compose simplifies the management of complex applications with multiple containers and their dependencies.

12) Docker Swarm (Orchestration Platform):
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, where containers can be scheduled and scaled across multiple hosts. Docker Swarm provides high availability, load balancing, and service discovery for containerized applications.

# Here's an overview of the topics regarding Kubernetes:

1) Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes (K8s):
Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are both container orchestration platforms, but there are some key differences. Docker Swarm is simpler to set up and has a more straightforward learning curve, making it suitable for smaller-scale deployments. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is more feature-rich and provides advanced capabilities for scaling, self-healing, and managing complex applications, making it more suitable for large-scale production environments.

2) Kubernetes Introduction:
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust ecosystem for running distributed systems, with features such as service discovery, load balancing, storage orchestration, and automatic rollouts and rollbacks.

3) Kubernetes Architecture:
Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture. The master node is responsible for managing the cluster and its components, including scheduling pods, scaling resources, and handling API requests. The worker nodes, also known as minions, run the application containers as pods and communicate with the master node.

4) Kubernetes Terminology:
Kubernetes introduces several key concepts and terminologies, including pods, services, deployments, namespaces, replica sets, and more. Pods are the basic unit of deployment and run one or more containers. Services provide network access to a set of pods, and deployments manage the rollout and updates of applications.

5) Kubernetes Setup (Self-Managed Cluster):
Setting up a self-managed Kubernetes cluster involves provisioning and configuring the master node and worker nodes manually. This can be done using tools like kubeadm, which helps bootstrap the cluster. You need to install and configure Kubernetes components, such as kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, kubelet, and kube-proxy, on the appropriate nodes.

6) EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service - AWS):
EKS is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. It simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on AWS by automatically provisioning and managing the master node infrastructure. With EKS, you only need to manage the worker nodes, while AWS takes care of the underlying control plane.

7) Namespaces:
Namespaces provide a way to divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. They enable logical separation, resource isolation, and access control within a cluster. By using namespaces, you can manage different environments, projects, or teams within a single Kubernetes cluster.

8) Pods:
A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share resources, such as network and storage. Pods are scheduled onto worker nodes and can run multiple containers that work together to provide a cohesive application.

9) Pod Lifecycle:
The lifecycle of a pod in Kubernetes goes through several phases, including pending, running, succeeded, failed, and unknown. Kubernetes monitors and manages the state of pods, ensuring that the desired number of replicas is running and taking action in case of failures or changes in the application.

10) Services (Cluster IP, Node Port, and Load Balancer):
Services provide a stable network endpoint to access a group of pods. Cluster IP services expose the service within the cluster. Node Port services expose the service on each node's IP at a static port. Load Balancer services provision an external load balancer to distribute traffic to the service.

11) ReplicationController & ReplicaSet:
ReplicationControllers (legacy) and ReplicaSets are responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods. They ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running and handle scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. ReplicaSets are the recommended approach for managing pods in modern Kubernetes versions.

12) DaemonSet & StatefulSet:
DaemonSets ensure that a specific pod runs on each node in the cluster, typically for cluster-wide tasks or system daemons. StatefulSets manage the deployment and scaling of stateful applications, such as databases, by providing stable network identities and persistent storage.

*** 13) Deployment (Recreate, Rolling Update & BlueGreen Methodology):
Deployments provide a declarative way to manage application updates and rollbacks. They support various update strategies, including recreating pods (recreate), rolling updates, and blue-green deployments. These strategies allow for controlled and automated updates to applications without downtime.

14) ConfigMap & Secrets:
ConfigMaps and Secrets are Kubernetes resources used to manage application configurations and sensitive data, respectively. ConfigMaps store key-value pairs or configuration files that can be injected into pods as environment variables or volumes. Secrets securely store sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, and can be mounted as volumes or injected into pods as environment variables.

14) K8S Volumes:
Kubernetes provides various volume types to manage data in pods. PersistentVolumes (PVs) are storage resources in the cluster that can be dynamically provisioned and attached to pods. PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) request storage resources and bind to available PVs. There are also other volume types, such as hostPath, emptyDir, and more.

15) HELM Charts:
HELM is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and manage applications as packages called charts. A chart includes all the necessary Kubernetes resources, such as deployments, services, and configmaps, along with customizable templates and values.

16) K8S Monitoring Tools:
Kubernetes can be monitored using various tools. Grafana is a popular tool for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards. Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting system that collects and stores time-series data. The ELK stack, consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash/Filebeat, and Kibana, can be used for log aggregation, parsing, and visualization.

# Application Development 

1) Collection of programs is called a software project:
A software project refers to a collection of programs, code, and files that work together to achieve a specific goal or provide a particular functionality. It typically includes multiple components, such as the front end, back end, and database components, which collectively make up the application.

1) Front end components (User interface logic):
Front-end components are responsible for the user interface logic of an application. They include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that create the visual and interactive elements that users interact with. Front-end components handle user input, display data, and facilitate communication with the back-end components.

1) Back end components (Business Logic):
Back-end components contain the business logic of an application. They handle the processing of data, perform calculations, enforce business rules, and interact with external systems or APIs. Back-end components are responsible for handling user requests, processing data, and generating responses to be sent back to the front-end.

1) Database Components (Persistence Logic):
Database components handle the persistence of data used by the application. They include database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and the associated schema, tables, and queries. Database components allow for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in a structured manner.

1) Setting up the required software for application deployment:
To deploy an application on a machine, you need to set up all the necessary software required for the application to run. This includes the operating system (OS), programming language (e.g., Java), web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat), database server (e.g., MySQL), and any additional libraries or frameworks needed by the application.

1) Deployment environments (DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT, and PROD):
In real-time projects, an application needs to be deployed in multiple environments for testing and production purposes. These environments include:

- DEV (Development): This environment is used by developers to perform integration testing and ensure that their changes work well together.

- SIT (System Integration Testing): This environment is used by the testing team to test the functionality and integration of the application components before moving to further stages.

- UAT (User Acceptance Testing): This environment is used by the client or end users to test the application's functionality, usability, and performance before it is approved for production.

- PILOT: The pilot environment is a pre-production testing environment that closely mimics the production environment. It is used to perform final tests and ensure that the application performs well in the production-like environment.

- PROD (Production): The production environment is the live environment where the application is deployed and made available to end users. It is the final stage and requires a stable and optimized setup to handle real-time traffic.

Setting up and managing different environments allows for proper testing, validation, and optimization of the application before it goes live in the production environment. It ensures that the application meets the required quality standards and performs as expected in different scenarios.
