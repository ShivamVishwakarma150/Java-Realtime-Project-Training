Application Development
+++++++++++++++++++++

-> Collection of programs is called as software project

-> Software project contains several components

		1) Front end components (User interface logic)

		2) Backend components (Business Logic)

		3) Database Components (Persistence Logic)


-> In order to deploy our application in a machine we need to setup all the Softwares which are required to our application

			Ex: OS, Java 1.8v, MYSQL DB, Tomcat Web Server 9.0v etc.....

-> In Realtime project should be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose

			Ex : DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT and PROD


-> DEV env will be used by Developers to perform integration testing

-> SIT env will be used by Testing team to test functionality of the application

-> UAT env will be used by Client to test functionality of the application

-> PILOT env means pre-production testing env

-> PROD means live environment (It is used to deliver the project)


-> To deploy application to these many environments we need to take of all the software required to run our application in all environments. It is very difficult task.
